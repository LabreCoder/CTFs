## Hello there,

# I am the CEO and one of the co-founders of futurevera.thm. In Futurevera, we believe that the future is in space. We do a lot of space research and write blogs about it. We used to help students with space questions, but we are rebuilding our support.

# Recently blackhat hackers approached us saying they could takeover and are asking us for a big ransom. Please help us to find what they can takeover.

# Our website is located at https://futurevera.thm

# Hint: Don't forget to add the MACHINE_IP in /etc/hosts for futurevera.thm ;
